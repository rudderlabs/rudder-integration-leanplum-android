# What is Rudder?

**Short answer:**
Rudder is an open-source Segment alternative written in Go, built for the enterprise.

**Long answer:**
Rudder is a platform for collecting, storing and routing customer event data to dozens of tools. Rudder is open-source, can run in your cloud environment (AWS, GCP, Azure or even your data-centre) and provides a powerful transformation framework to process your event data on the fly.

## Getting Started with LeanPlum Integration of Android SDK
1. Add [LeanPlum](https://www.leanplum.com) as a destination in the [Dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and define `applicationId`, and `clientKey`. If you turn on the Development Environment flag, make sure to put your development key in `clientKey`.

2. Setup the Hybrid Mode of integration:
  - Turning on the switch beside `Initialize Native SDK to send automated events` in the dashboard will initialize the LeanPlum native SDK in the application.
  - Turning on the switch beside `Use native SDK to send user generated events` in the dashboard will instruct your `data-plane` to skip the events for LeanPlum and the events will be sent from the LeanPlum SDK.

3. Add these lines to your ```app/build.gradle```
```
repositories {
    maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/rudderstack/rudderstack" }
}
```
4. Add the dependency under ```dependencies```
```
// Rudder core sdk and leanplum extension
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.0.2'
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:leanplum:1.0.1'

// leanplum core sdk
implementation 'com.leanplum:leanplum-core:5.3.3'

// gson
implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'
```

## Initialize ```RudderClient```
```
val rudderClient: RudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
    this,
    <WRITE_KEY>,
    RudderConfig.Builder()
        .withDataPlaneUrl(<DATA_PLANE_URL>)
        .withFactory(LeanPlumIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)
        .build()
)
```
